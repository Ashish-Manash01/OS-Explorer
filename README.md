# OS-Explorer
The website at the provided URL is a project called OS Explorer, which is a visualizer for core operating system concepts. It offers simulations and explorations of various topics, including:

CPU Scheduling: Algorithms like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin.

Memory Management: Techniques such as MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks), MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks), and different fit algorithms.

Deadlock Handling: The Banker's Algorithm and Resource Allocation Graphs.

File and Disk Management: File organization and disk scheduling algorithms.

Page Replacement: Algorithms like FIFO, Optimal, and LRU.

Advanced Topics: System calls, inter-process communication, and process synchronization.
